 * @brief  Abstract memory shims to allow swapping out allocators
 *
 * This file's purpose is to allow us to easily replace the memory
 * allocator used by Ganesha.  Further, it provides a pool abstraction
 * that may be implemented in terms of the normal allocator that may
 * be expanded at a later date.  These are intended to be thin
 * wrappers, but conditionally compiled trace information could be
 * added.

 * linking in alternate allocator libraries (tcmalloc and jemalloc, at
 * present.)  So long as the interface remains the same, these
 * functions can be switched out using ifdef for versions that do more
 * memory tracking or that call allocators with other names.
